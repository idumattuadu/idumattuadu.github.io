To save my bum from getting kicked for the fake bravado I demonstrated<br>
There you were<br>
To kick on my bums for the studies I procrastinated<br>
There you were<br>
To join in the pun while everyone remonstrated<br>
There you were<br>

To take me out to the cricket ground only to keep wicket<br>
There you were<br>
To take me to movie in dilapidated hall on a third class ticket<br>
There you were<br>

To take me to the farms on a bicycle that squeaked<br>
There you were<br>
To drop me at the railway station on a Bullet that creaked<br>
There you were<br>

To wrestle with vocabulary or to wrestle with arms<br>
There you were<br>
To depress with drudgery or to delight with charms<br>
There you were<br>
To irradiate and irritate; to imitate and infuriate<br>
There you were<br>

To grow old and make more meaningless memories<br>
There you are notâ€¦.
