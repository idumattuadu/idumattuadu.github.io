Dear ***Guru Dada***,

It's been almost three months since we've spoken and over two and half months since we communicated in any form. You have been on my mind almost everyday as I reminiscenced our shared past. It is then I realized that we have never written letters to each other. So, I thought, I'd make a new beginning. In any case, I can't pickup the phone and call you whenever I fancied a counsel or fight or analysing state of cricket or politics now, can I?

When we had the time, we did discuss quite a lot, didn't we, *Da*? The topics ranged from Cricket to Politics to Theology to Anthropology. You always held your forte in any of them with your elephantine memory that you so jealously acquired from a very young age. Your enthusiasm for current affairs and sundry knowledge knew no boundary. The first thing you searched for in a new town was library. I fondly remember you taking me to that decrepit central library in *Bidar* some evenings. You introduced me to Op-Ed pages, as you devoured writings of Shouries, Mehtas, Ted Corbetts of the world. In a way you did pique my interest and majorly influence me into reading long pieces of glorified opinions on Sports, Politics, Philosophy. I didn't tell you that before, did I?
