A long time ago, it was late into the night, by the village's standards. It looked like everybody had fallen asleep after dinner and some chit chats. The streets were dark and empty. There were no street lights. It was the time when grown up adults didn't want to venture out, fearing the stillness of the night. The village boys had heard and told a lot of stories filled with ghosts that danced in the corner of a desolate old palatial house. Ghosts that were easily seen by animals of the canine and feline family but rarely by humans. The infrequent wailing of the street dogs seemed to confirm this hypothesis as did the furious growling of cats seemingly in a standoff. The cats were considered to be more courageous of the four legged animals that roamed the streets in night. They never cried but often growled. There was hardly a buzz or noise outside, apart from these humans accustomed animals or an odd flutter of bats, who were just as nocturnal as the ghosts in the boys' stories.

There was, however, quite a buzz in a small room of not a large house in the village. There was an excitable 18 odd years old boy humming and brimming with excitement in the room. He was about to do something that not many or almost no one had done in his village. He was about to venture into the unknown in the dead of the night. His father would be furious, like the cats, when he found out about the boy's endeavor. And the father was bound to find out, the boy knew. But this new adventure he was about to embark upon, made the boy oblvious to his father's fury. He was prepared to get shouted at for it. He was after all about to the explore a whole new world in the cloak of the darkness and stillness of the night like no one else had in the village. Virtually. He was about to connect to the Internet. The buzz that filled his room was coming from a device that'd take him to the Internet. It was the sound of a modem, connecting to the interent. Not just any modem, but a DIALUP MODEM. It was like that famed motorcycle, the Bullet, coming to life when it was fired up with a kick or, as was the typical case, several of them. The bullet made a thump while the modem made the buzz. But they both carried their masters on fascinating adventures. As the connection came alive, he fired up his Yahoo! Messenger and sent a simple 'Hi' to his friend in a far away city. They were on holidays from college. The friend responded 'Hello' and the boy's joy had no bounds. He opened a few websites that he had learned about at the college. They all came alive on his computer. Slowly. Very slowly. Like his first train journey that took him to the state's capital.

The boy had discovered the Internet just a few days back after joining his engineering college earlier in the year. To get an admission into that college he had to go to the state's capital city, Bengluru, located about 700 odd kilo meters away from his village. Oddly, it was called the counselling although nobody counselled him about anything over there. His father had taken him to the capital in a train which they boarded from a nearby town. That was also when he discovered train journeys. And it was a memory that'd remain etched in his mind. The train arrived quite late than the time displayed on their ticket. And when it arrived, it was filthy like the streets of his village. People, he observed, abandoned their garbage just about anywhere, like in the village, and nobody seemed to mind. Toilets were just a hole in the floor, again like the one in his home back in the village with one important difference though - this one had a door with a latch. But you get the drift.

The train, despite all the shortcomings, did fascinate him. The sheer length of it and the number of people it transported boggled his impressionalbe mind. And the length could be shortened or elongated based on requirement his father explained. This could be done by removig or adding, what his father and others as he discovered later referred in their native tounge as *dabbi* or in Hindi as *dabba*. The official name for them was *coaches* he came to know later. Considering these metal boxes did not *coach* anyone or anything referring them as *dabbi* or *dabba* somehow felt more appropriate to him. His father gave him another fun fact about the trains. They could be merged and demerged as and when needed and their train to *Bengaluru* was one of those. Half of it would reach *Bengaluru* and other other half to some other city, the boy was told. Marvelous!

The boy slept that night in the train wondering if they were in the right *dabbi* that was destined for *Bengaluru*. He expected to be in *Bengaluru* when he woke up. That did not happen. He woke up, sat and got bored and asked his father hesitatingly if they were in the right *dabbi*. His father confirmed they were. The train was just slow, he added. Not just slow, very slow. The boy told himself. After all it had been over 20 hours since they started. It was not running but crawling at a very slow pace. When they completed their journey to and from *Bengaluru*, the boy was dissapointed and fascinated in equal measures. But his affair with the trains would continue for a long time to come, just like his relation with the Internet.

Cut to the present day and the boy had grown into a man. A man who had left his little village long back, lived, studied and worked across different parts of the country, let alone the state. He has experienced/witnessed the evolution or transformation of the Internet. From the days of using the dialup modems with speeds of **56Kbps** through the landline his father had got installed waiting for months after applying for it, to the handheld wonder called a smartphone that connected the Internet without a wire at speeds of in excess of **560Mbps**. The Internet's journey had truly been transformational and overwhelming. The trains' journey on the other hand had been underwhelming. He had experienced all the latest trains that were claimed to be greatest and named quite ostensibly like *Garib Rath*, or ambitiously like *Duranto* and *Shatabdi*. Sure, the toilets were no more a hole in the floor and the *dabbis* were a lot cleaner, but it still felt like they crawled.

Until today, that is. Today the man experienced the newly introduced and ornamentally named train - The Vande Bharat. The train is unlike any other he has experienced. The closing doors, the automatic sliding doors to the coaches, the swanky clean toilets, the table or trays that can act as a table at the seats can be termed worldclass. And then there's the aspect of speed. It runs smoothly at 130KMPH only because the tracks beneath it don't allow it go further. And at that speed it doesn't make you spill your coffee. Marvellous! While, it may not be transformational yet, but it surely feels like the beginning of a transformation.

As he approaches his destination, the boy, a man now wonders if his village and the region where it's located, ornamentally again, named as *Kalyana Karnataka* will get some transformation too. Or in other words, when will they get some *Kalyana*.
