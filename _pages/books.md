I'll try to keep this page updated with the interesting books that I have read and recommend.

To begin with, this is a list of books I have read in 2021. The target for the year is to read 24 books. I'll keep updating the table as and when I complete a book.

| The Polymer Prince | Hamish McDonald | Non-Fiction | 4 | Fascinating tale of the rise of Reliance |
| The Great Indian Novel | Shashi Tharoor | Fiction | 3 | Mahabharata transformed into India's struggles before and after Independence |
