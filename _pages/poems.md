## Freedom


You bring me joy<br>
You make me smile<br>
Out with you<br>
I desire to travel many a mile<br>

Glimpse of you brings me to deep thinking<br>
And my dreary eyes they forget blinking<br>

But when I am with you<br>
The realisation is quite sudden<br>
You are but a fruit forbidden!<br>

## Brother

To save my bum from getting kicked for the fake bravado I demonstrated<br>
There you were<br>
To kick on my bums for the studies I procrastinated<br>
There you were<br>
To join in the pun while everyone remonstrated<br>
There you were<br>

To take me out to the cricket ground only to keep wicket<br>
There you were<br>
To take me to movie in dilapidated hall on a third class ticket<br>
There you were<br>

To take me to the farms on a bicycle that squeaked<br>
There you were<br>
To drop me at the railway station on a Bullet that creaked<br>
There you were<br>

To wrestle with vocabulary or to wrestle with arms<br>
There you were<br>
To depress with drudgery or to delight with charms<br>
There you were<br>
To irradiate and irritate; to imitate and infuriate<br>
There you were<br>

To grow old and make more meaningless memories<br>
There you are notâ€¦.

## Forgotten

Wretched Time is busy playing its dirty trick<br>
Memories have begun to fade unsettlingly quick<br>
Shenanigans that were enacted in collusion<br>
Appear like a warped mind's desperate delusion
