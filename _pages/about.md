Hello there!

I am *Gopal*, a passionately consummate procrastinator. I enjoy the *www* a lot - *wheels, words and wanderings*, not necessarily in that order.

I have been blogging sporadically since a few years. I started with Blogger and later moved onto Medium. *Idu Mattu Adu*, which means 'This And That' in *Kannada*, is an extension of this journey. I'll attempt to share my thoughts, experiences or even imaginations.

Professionally, I am a Software Engineer (such a cliche, I know!) working in the field of Networking and Security. You can look me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalvkulkarni), for a summary of my professional career thus far.

You can use the following form to drop me a message.
